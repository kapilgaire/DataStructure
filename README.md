# Data Structure
## [Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/)
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

## [Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)

Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

## [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/)
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

## [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
